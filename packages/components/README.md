# Components

## Overview

This package contains a collection of shared components designed for use across the codebase. These components are intended for larger, more complex UI elements that do not fit within a traditional design system. By centralizing these components, we aim to promote reusability, maintainability, and consistency throughout our applications.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this package is to provide a robust set of components that can be easily integrated into various applications within our monorepo. These components are built with scalability in mind, ensuring that they can handle complex use cases while remaining easy to use.

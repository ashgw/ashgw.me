  **Dumb questions exist.** And they're not just annoying, they're a sign that
  something is fundamentally broken. Let me define it for you: a dumb question
  is any question that could've been answered by a little bit of effort on your
  part. If the answer exists out there, easily accessible in a documentation
  page, a Google search, or a previously shared resource, then congratulations,
  you've just asked a dumb question.
</C>

<C>
  Now, before you get defensive, let me clarify: the problem isn't just you.
  Dumb questions are a symptom of **inefficient systems, poor institutional
  memory, and lazy habits.** If you have to ask something obvious, it means
  there's a gap in the system.
</C>

<C>
  A non-dumb question, on the other hand, is something you've **worked to figure
  out but couldn't.** You've searched, you've read, you've tried, and you've
  come up short. Maybe the documentation is unclear, maybe the information
  doesn't exist in any accessible form, or maybe it's highly specialized
  knowledge that only a specific person can provide. That's when it's worth
  asking someone, because you're not wasting their time, and you're respecting
  their expertise.
</C>

<C>
  This is why systems matter. Documentation is the antidote to dumb questions.
  Every critical decision, every architectural choice, every key implementation
  detail should be documented. Why? So people don't waste time repeating the
  same conversations, rediscovering the same solutions, or asking the same dumb
  questions.
</C>

<C>
  If you're asking dumb questions, it's often because the system around you is
  broken. And if you're hearing dumb questions all day long, it's time to fix
  that system. Preserve the knowledge. Document everything. Share it widely.
  Build mechanisms for distributing information efficiently so no one has to ask
  the same thing twice.
</C>

<C>
  This is the essence of progress. Think about it: human civilization only
  advanced because we learned how to preserve knowledge. Writing was invented so
  that ideas and discoveries wouldn't be lost with the death of the person who
  came up with them. If knowledge isn't preserved, it gets forgotten. If it gets
  forgotten, humanity repeats its mistakes.
</C>

<C>
  You've probably heard theories about ancient civilizations that lost all their
  advancements because they failed to preserve their knowledge. Whether it's
  Göbekli Tepe or others, the lesson is the same: **knowledge lost is humanity
  stalled.** The same applies to your team, your company, your project. If
  information isn't packaged and distributed, to be easily accessible, you're
  setting yourself up for failure.
</C>

<C>
  In software, repeating tasks is a cardinal sin. You don't rewrite the same
  function ten times, you abstract it. You don't manually deploy your app every
  time, you setup infra and you automate it. The same mindset applies to
  knowledge. If you're repeating the same explanations or answering the same
  questions over and over, you're doing it wrong. The solution is simple: create
  systems that preserve and distribute knowledge so effectively that dumb
  questions disappear.
</C>

<C>
  If you're in an environment where dumb questions are the norm, fix the system.
  Build a better knowledge infrastructure. Create better resources. Share
  knowledge widely and make it digestible. The fewer dumb questions people ask,
  the closer you are to having a truly efficient, productive team.
</C>

<C>
  Because at the end of the day, a dumb question is merely a symptom of a broken
  process. Fix the process, and you'll fix the questions.
</C>

<C>
  And when you fix the questions, you fix the money. Every minute saved, every
  confusion avoided, every project that doesn’t spiral off into meetings and
  guesswork, it all stacks. Less wasted payroll. Faster execution. Less churn.
  More momentum. Over time, it’s not even close. The teams that preserve
  knowledge move cheaper, faster, and further than the ones who don't. And the
  gap only grows.

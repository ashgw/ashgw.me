  I stopped debating a long time ago with people. Debate rarely works. Most of
  the time, people do not engage to discover truth, they engage to protect
  themselves, a survival mechanism of the mind. They listen not to understand
  but to respond. They scan for flaws, not insight. The exchange becomes a
  contest, instead of a conversation.

  When a belief feels threatened, the mind reaches for defense. Doubt becomes
  dangerous. Certainty becomes armor. Changing your position starts to feel like
  surrender. Pride overrides reason. Even when the logic is clean, even when the
  argument is irrefutable, resistance still holds firm. The desire to win
  eclipses the possibility of growth, always.

  People do not defend ideas, they defend identity. A belief repeated often
  enough begins to feel like part of the self, so to let go of it feels like
  letting go of something vital. The more public the position, the more
  permanent it becomes.

  This is why persuasion rarely works through confrontation. The louder the
  facts, the deeper the resistance. When someone feels exposed, they entrench.
  When they feel attacked, they distort, thus they seek retaliation.

  Actual change happens in quiet. It happens when the conditions are right. When
  no one is watching. When there is room for thought to move. Insight is not
  downloaded through pressure. It emerges when the pressure lifts.

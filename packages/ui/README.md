# Design System Package

This package serves as the foundational design system for the apps. It is intended to hold only the bare primitives necessary for constructing UI components.

## Purpose

- **Bare Primitives**: This package should only include the essential building blocks of our design system, such as colors, typography, spacing, and basic styles.
- **No Major Components**: It is not meant to contain complex components or higher-level abstractions. Instead, it focuses on providing the fundamental elements that can be used to build more complex UI components elsewhere.

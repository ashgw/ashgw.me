<C>
No completed tasks = no pay.

<H2>Cycle</H2>


<C>
My billing cycle operates on a weekly basis, where I include charges for closed tasks from the preceding week.

Formula
</H2>


<C>
Since each task comes with a predefined estimate, typically ranging from five minutes to an hour, which remains fixed, I personally have an hourly rate set at **$60**. In the event of full-scale <L href="/services/full-software-solution">project development</L>, it often involves more than just myself. Therefore, each <L href="/service/glossary#team">team</L> member has their own hourly rate, which will be <L href="/services/communication">communicated</L> to you.

<C>
The cost for each [task]() is determined by the following formula:
</C>


<C>
task_cost = task_estimated_hours * hourly_rate

Payment Methods

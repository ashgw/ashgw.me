Billing Formula
</H2>


<C>
Since each task comes with a predefined estimate, typically ranging from 30 minutes to an hour, which remains fixed, I have an hourly rate set at **$30**. In the event of full-scale <L href="/services/full-project-development">project development</L>, it often involves more than just myself. Therefore, each <L href="/service/glossary#team">team</L> member has their own hourly rate, which will be communicated to you.

</C>


<C>
task_cost = task_estimated_hours * hourly_rate

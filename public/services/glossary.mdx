<C>
The glossary serves as a compilation of terms used throughout the project's requirements, so there's no room for ambiguity.
</C>
<H3 id="ticket">Ticket/Issue/Task</H3>
<C>
These terms are used interchangeably to refer to tasks that need to be completed within a specified <L href="/services/deadlines">timeframe.</L> They are submitted through the <L href="/services/deadlines">ticket system</L> and they mostly fall down into two main categories.
<S2/>
- \- **Features:** Refers to a functionality that needs to be implemented, specified as a <L href="/services/glossary#user-stories">User Story.</L>
- \- **Issues:** Refers to various issues within a project. Such as: design flaws, unclear documentation, coding inconsistencies (maintainability issues), deviation from best practices, general errors, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, scalability issues and more.
<S2/>
A ticket serves as a link between two key individuals: the problem reporter and the problem resolver, they can be the same person, but never more than two, this is how we know who delivered what, and how much money they deserve, since <L href="/services/billing">billing</L> is based upon deliverables, not <L href="/blog/management-skill-issues">time spent</L> looking at the screen.
</C>

<H3 id="ticket-system">Ticket System</H3>
<C>
 [Tickets]() are submitted as GitHub issues, they form the basis for all actions within the project, including <L href="/services/communication">communication.</L>
 <S/>
 Issues are:
 <S2/>
- \- **Measurable:**  If it's a large piece of work, then it will be broken down to small and easy measurable tasks, each not surpassing 1 hour of work.
- \- **Templated:** Have a template: Feature Request, Bug, Documentation, Research, and other  available types
- \- **Labeled:** With a <L href="">priority</L> level and estimated time for completion, additional labels may be present too.
- \- <L href="">**S.M.A.R.T**</L>
<S2/>

<H3 id="requirements">Requirements</H3>
<C>
- \- **Functional:** The specific behaviors, features, and capabilities that the software or product must exhibit. These requirements focus on describing what the software should do rather than how it should be implemented, expressed through <L href="/services/glossary#user-stories">User Stories.</L>
- \- **Non-Functional:**  Standards for system performance, using **quantifiable** benchmarks instead of vague terms. For instance, server scalability may be defined by achieving a minimum uptime of 99.89%, rather than simply labeling it as "fault-tolerant".

</C>
<H3 id="user-stories">User Stories</H3>
<C>
Expressed through <L href="https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin">Gherkin</L> files. These files double as acceptance tests, to ensure a clear understanding while providing a means of verification for the software's functionality.

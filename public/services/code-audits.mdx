<H2>Why You Need One ?</H2>
<C>
I wrote an <L href="/blog/independent-code-audit">article</L> about why your software needs independent code audits.

In short, I talked about how independent audits can help mitigate issues stemming from a lack of oversight within internal teams (here's <L href="/blog/tag/skill-issues">why</L>). 
Without vigilant scrutiny of <L href="/blog/tag/quality">quality</L> and architectural integrity, problems can escalate unnoticed, hindering future development, which leads to project failures and loss of money.

I only audit for projects that use my <L href="/about">stack.</L>

The business audit is designed for business owners seeking clarity on their project's status. It provides a concise one-page review covering crucial aspects such as suitability for future modifications, flexibility in team adjustments and code quality assessment. Additionally, clients are free to ask questions pose specific inquiries to address their unique concerns.

My business audit is a fixed one-day service priced at **$500**.

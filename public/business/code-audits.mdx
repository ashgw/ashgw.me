<H2>Why You Need One ?</H2>
<C>
I wrote an <L href="/blog/independent-code-audit">article</L> about why your software needs independent code audits.

In short, I talked about how independent audits can help mitigate issues stemming from a lack of oversight within internal teams (here's <L href="/blog/management-skill-issues">why</L>). 
Without vigilant scrutiny of <L href="/blog/software-quality">quality</L> and architectural integrity, problems can escalate unnoticed, hindering future development, which leads to project failures and loss of money.

My audits come in two forms:

<H3>Business</H3>
<C>
The business audit is designed for business owners seeking clarity on their project's status. It provides a concise one-page review covering crucial aspects such as suitability for future modifications, flexibility in team adjustments and [code quality]() assessment. Additionally, clients can pose specific inquiries to address their unique concerns.

My business audit is a fixed one-day service priced at **$500**.

<H3>Technical</H3>
<C>
For technical teams, my technical audit aids in uncovering hidden <L href="/business/glossary#ticket">bugs</L> and optimizing code performance. I operate on a model where I charge solely based on the bugs found. No bugs = free audit.

This is not a fixed day service, it might take as long as needed.

Each identified bug is priced at **$10**.

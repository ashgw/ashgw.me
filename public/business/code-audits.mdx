<H3>Code Audits</H3>
<C>
I wrote a [blog]() about why your software needs independent code audits.

<C>
In short, I talked about issues stemming from a lack of oversight within internal teams, here's the biggest reason [why](). 
Without vigilant scrutiny of [code quality]() and architectural integrity, problems can escalate unnoticed, hindering future development, which leads to project failures and loss of money, [-EV](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Poker/Expected_value) move.

My audits come in two forms: Business and Technical.

<H3>Business</H3>

The business audit is designed for business owners seeking clarity on their project's status. It provides a concise one-page review covering crucial aspects such as suitability for future modifications, flexibility in team adjustments and [code quality]() assessment. Additionally, clients can pose specific inquiries to address their unique concerns.

My business audit is a fixed one-day service priced at $500.

<H3>Technical</H3>
<C>
For technical teams, my technical audit aids in uncovering hidden bugs and optimizing code performance. I operate on a model where I charge solely based on the [bugs]() found. No bugs = free audit.

This is not a fixed day service, it might take as long as needed.

Each identified bug is priced at $10.

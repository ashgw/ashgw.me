# Captionize 📷

### Web application that automatically generates descriptive captions for images using a Blind Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP) model.

## Overview 🎥

https://github.com/AshGw/Captionize/assets/126174609/81840a72-2b9d-4a48-a56e-e19d8f5fb14c

## Installation 🛠️

To install and run the app on any machine, you can choose from two methods:

Using Docker for isolation or, if you already have Python installed, the latter option.

**During the installation process, you will receive instructions on how to re-run the app if needed.**

> **NOTE: The installation may take some time as the dependencies are quite heavy.**

### Docker 🐳

1. Install **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)** If you don't have it already.
2. Next, run this command in an empty directory using your terminal or **[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** for windows.

```shell
curl -sSfl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AshGw/Captionize/main/setup/docker-auto-run.sh | bash
```

That's it, the app should now be up and running at:

> _http://localhost:7854_

### Python 🐍

1. Install **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)** (3.10+) if you don't have it already.
2. Next, run this command in an empty directory using your terminal or **[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** for windows.

```shell
curl -sSfl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AshGw/Captionize/main/setup/install.sh | bash
```

This command will install the entire project, sets up the virtual environment, installs dependencies and then runs the app.

You can view it at:

> _http://localhost:8000_

## Keynote 📝

The app includes the model directly on your machine, which means you can use the app **offline**, no need for an internet connection.

During the initial image captioning process, there will be a delay as additional dependencies are installed.

<br />

It should work smoothly after, if:

- For Docker: Subsequent runs of the container.
- For Python: Keeping the same virtual environment activated.

          and philosopher. Oh I almost forgot, yeah and a software developer

      <Card title="Hi, I'm Ashref Gwader">
        <p>
          I&apos;m a technical educator, poker player, motorcycle enthusiast,
          basketball player, health enthusiast, thinker, and philosopher. Oh,
          and I almost forgotâ€”I&apos;m also a software developer from Tunisia.
          Over the past 7+ years, I&apos;ve been involved in building, scaling,
          and organizing software teams, collaborating with over 100 startups
          worldwide. My expertise lies predominantly in web technologies,
          including HTTP/2, HTTP/3, gRPC, GraphQL, and other related
          technologies. Apart from web development, I advocate for quality code,
          particularily for Python and Typescript, which often involves
          reviewing and correcting code and design decisions, whether or not
          they are directly related to web development.

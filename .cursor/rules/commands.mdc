Almost all commands in the monorepo should be executed when `pnpm run ...` from the root of the monorepo. For example, installing packages for the `@ashgw/blog` app:

```
pnpm --filter @ashgw/blog add @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/react-query @trpc/next @tanstack/react-query zod
```

Never use `pnpm run ...` from the root of the monorepo.

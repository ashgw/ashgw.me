Think carefully and only ation the specific task I have given you with the most concise and elegant solution that changes as little code as possible

also while you're at it, when creating UI components, I use shadcn components located at packages/ui 
default to them, if not found ask the user to install the shadcn component, if not possible then create the component yourself like normal

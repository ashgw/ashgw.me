Think carefully and address only the specific task requested, using the most concise, elegant solution that changes as little code as possible.

also while you're at it, when creating UI components, I use shadcn components located at packages/ui
default to them, if not found ask the user to install the shadcn component, if not possible then create the component yourself like normal

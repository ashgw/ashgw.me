# Naming Convetion

You have one entrypoint for the CI: ci.yaml. This file does nothing except orchestrate, it just calls the right workflow using workflow*call. It should have \_no* logic. No envs. No steps. Just pure sequential dispatch. Who comes first and how you manage the concurrency flow.

Every real job lives in its own file, and every file follows a naming formula:

on-<trigger>-<type>-<what>

So:  
on-issue-label-check-reproduction  
on-pr-label-deploy-app-preview  
on-workflow-call-lint  
on-issue-label-notify

You separate each part by dashes. The trigger is like pr, issue, workflow-call. The type is the event: open, label, target, etc. The what is whatever that workflow does.

If it's a cron job, name it like this:  
<cron>-<what>  
cron-daily-summary  
cron-clean-old-sessions  
No need for "on-" since it's time based.

If a workflow doesnâ€™t fit the formula, or has too much shit going on, sure, name it however you want. Just keep everything that can be structured visibly clear with the formula. When you open the workflows folder, it should read like a timeline, not a guessing game.

Keep the files under workflows/ lean. Even the ones that are dispatched directly (like via workflow_dispatch) should just call an action. The real work should be in actions (or scripts).

Actions can be refactored. They can run bash. Call scripts. Live anywhere. Be reused. Tracked. Versioned.
